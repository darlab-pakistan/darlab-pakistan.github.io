## PSX NetworksMore actions

This project aims to curate, structure, and analyze data related to corporate board memberships for companies listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). By constructing interlocking directorate networks - where individuals serve on multiple boards—the project seeks to uncover patterns of influence, governance structures, and connectivity among firms in Pakistan’s corporate landscape.


We will be releasing different datasets under this project at different times. You can access each dataset by clicking the links provided below:
