# Pakistan Justice Data

There is a significant gap in knowledge and practice regarding Pakistan's legal system due to a lack of comprehensive and accessible data on its functioning. Currently, the general public has very limited awareness of the operations and dynamics of Pakistan's legal system. This lack of information hampers public understanding of how the system works and how it has changed since colonial times. Furthermore, there is generally a negative perception of the justice system due to delays in justice delivery. The lack of data prevents researchers from investigating the efficacy of the system, exploring determinants of case outcomes, or suggesting improvements.

This project aims to construct a dataset of Pakistan's courts to better understand the quantitative characteristics of the legal system. We hope to establish a baseline understanding of the judicial process. The dataset would enable the development of metrics such as case duration, bench formation, and judge characteristics. The availability of Pakistanâ€™s legal data, open to the wider community for analysis, would help contextualize issues locally and enable richer insights due to the religious and socio-cultural understanding of local scholars and researchers. We aim to fill this gap to foster informed discussions and improve public awareness of legal processes and procedures.

We will be releasing different datasets under this project at different times. You can access each dataset by clicking the links provided below:
